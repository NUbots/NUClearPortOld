\section{Introduction}
	This document outlines the scope of testing applied to the implementation of the new architecture for the RoboCup codebase.
	The original architecture relied primarily on manual processes for all testing.

	The project team believe that the new architecture should utilise automated testing whenever feasible with manual testing a backup option.

	In the new architecture, functionality is separated into discrete modules that communicate through messages.
	Accordingly, unit tests can be separated into per-module tests that provide clean separation of concerns and simple mechanisms for mocking and validating inputs/outputs.
	The project team have also identified a number of cases where integration tests can be performed on module subsets, further reducing the complexity of testing in the system.
	End-to-end testing will still require manual validation as fully automated end-to-end testing would require an emulation layer for the robots hardware that was outside the scope of this project.

\section{Scope}
	The newly ported system has been split into many mutually exclusive sub modules.
	Many are able to be tested in isolation using unit tests.
	Some of the modules however, must be manually tested due to their reliance on hardware in the system.
	An outline of the modules that have been ported and built on the new system as well as the testing method required are outlined below. \\

\section{Modules}
	\subsection{AubioBeatDetector \& BeatDetector}
		AubioBeatDetector detects beats in a supplied audio stream using the Aubio library.
		BeatDetector detects beats using the Beat'n algorithm.
		As both of these modules have identical input and output, the testing method for these two modules is also identical.
		Beats are reported as the time the beat occurred and the tempo.
		These two modules can be tested through automated unit testing.

		\begin{itemize}
			\item This module is required to be able to accept a stream of audio chunks in PCM format and locate beats within it.
			\item The beats, when found, should be immediately emitted containing both the absolute time the beat occurred, and the estimated frequency of the beats.
			\item The beat detector must maintain above 90\% accuracy when provided with an audio file with a significant beat.
		\end{itemize}

		\paragraph{Assumptions:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Prior to any sound data being received, the system will have received configuration information describing the sample rate, chunk size and data frequency to be used.
			\item The sound information sent has a distinguishable beat. Failing this, the output is undefined.

\section{Integration Testing}
	The design of the new architecture is to take advantage of the Service Oriented Architecture concept of Orchestration.
	This concept involves taking many modules of functionality and combining them to make an application.
	There are many interactions between modules that can be used to perform integration testing using related modules.
	The diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:links} shows how the modules that have been implemented in the port so far interact with each other's outputs.
	By taking any of the modules that are able to be automatically unit tested together, an integration test can be built that checks the modules work together as expected.

\section{Simulation Testing}
	By implementing modules that simulate the hardware components of the robotic platform, it is possible to perform a full simulation.
	There currently exists two simulation engines that are able to perform high level simulations for the robot system.
	Webots and Simspark are both based on the Open Dynamic Engine (ODE), which is an open source physics and rigid body simulator.
	This allows high level simulations of the robot’s environment. These systems allow testing on the entirety of the robotic system to be performed without requiring physical access to a robot.

	Webots or Simspark can be used to provide implementations for the simulated hardware components.
	For the current system, DarwinHardwareIO, DarwinMotionManager, LinuxCameraStreamer and AudioInput can be replaced with simulated equivalents.
	In the case of Webots, the API can be used directly in the modules as Webots provides a C++ API.
	In the case of Simspark, the API is provided using a set of TCP/UDP sockets.
	Instead, modules can be created that read from the sockets and pass the appropriate information to the system.
	Easy integration of the new system into Webots or Simspark provides greater testing capabilities.
